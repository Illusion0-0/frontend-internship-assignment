# Fyle Frontend Challenge

I have successfully implemented the following features in the application:

1. Search by book title or author name: Users can now search for books based on either the title or author name. The search functionality is implemented to fetch relevant results based on user input.

2. Paginated results: The search results are paginated, allowing users to view a limited number of results per page and navigate through the pages to view more results.

3. Clear search text: Users can easily clear the search text input field to reset the search and start a new search query.

4. Handling edge cases related to API calls: The application is designed to handle various edge cases related to API calls, such as handling errors, displaying proper messages when no results are found.

5. Loaders while fetching data: Loaders are implemented on the page to provide visual feedback to users while fetching data from APIs, ensuring a smooth user experience during data retrieval.

6. Back button: A Back button is added to the Trending Subjects page, allowing users to easily navigate back to the home page from the Trending Subjects page.

7. Caching API responses: Caching mechanisms are implemented to store API responses locally, improving performance and reducing unnecessary API calls, thereby optimizing the application's data retrieval process.
